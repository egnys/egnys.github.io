			<p>The mage is a DPS caster that specializes in burst damage and area of effect spells. Their primary role in a group is damage dealing and crowd control through the use of Polymorph. At end-game levels, mage damage is supplemented with spells like Counterspell and Spellsteal. Mage utility spells also include conjuring food and drink and the ability to teleport to major cities and open portals for party members. In PvP, magi deal ranged damage while using snare effects and Polymorph to control enemy players.</p>

			<h2>Lore</h2>
			<p>Magi, the most common of arcanists, are found all over Azeroth. They focus on magic that creates and changes things, most often with the purpose of damaging their enemies and boosting the power of their allies. Such beings can obtain a familiar, which is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a mage, while others choose to become a focused mage. Magi also understand the workings of arcane energy so well they can counter most magic with great effectiveness. Those who have dedication to and natural predilection for one of the schools of specialization becomes more entrenched. At this point they choose either evocation or transmutation as a preferred school. The magi of the Kirin Tor first mastered the art of casting spells using the elements of ice and fire. Magi are also known for being able to summon elementals, usually water elementals, but can also summon air, earth, and fire elementals. The greatest mortal mage ever to have lived is the naga, Queen Azshara. In fact, she may no longer be mortal. The first known magi on Azeroth were elves. They existed before the breaking of the Well of Eternity and the Exile of the High Elves, who lived on the shores of the Well of Eternity and wielded its tremendous magic powers.</p>

			<p>Magi can use wands, daggers, one-handed swords, or staves. Wands go in the main hand, continue to shoot once manually started, and do not require any form of ammunition. A mage can only wear cloth armor.</p>

			<h2>Spell types</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Arcane spells include single-target damage spells and utility. Arcane spells allow mages to remove curses, provide crowd control, absorb damage, teleport themselves or others to major capital cities, Slow Fall, Counterspell, buff players' intellect stat, save mana for later use in the form of mana gems, conjure food and water for himself or others, and provide many other conveniences.
				</li>
				<li>
					Fire spells are primarily damage-dealing spells, including direct single-target damage and area of effect damage. Many fire spells include damage over time effects.
				</li>
				<li>Frost spells are primarily single-target and area of effect damage-dealing spells, but with more emphasis on chilling effects. Nearly every frost spell has a chill or freeze effect that fully or partially immobilizes an enemy. This includes freezing it in place (called a root) or slowing its movement speed (called a snare). Frost specialized magi can further improve these chilling effects and increase frost damage output to respectable levels. Frost spells help the mage use kiting as a combat tactic.</li>
